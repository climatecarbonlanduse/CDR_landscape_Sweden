The files here are the codes needed to understand the methodology, the construction of the method and framework developed and to understand the results from the article.

These involve:

Creating the crop groups with creaging_main_cropgroup.py

Creating the main rotations and the structure with Rotation_structure.py

Putting crop groups together wtih agriculture_model_construct.py

Resulting in the main model output that is found in the main model for CDR.py script.

This togehter is the combined model constructed to produce the results of the article.
